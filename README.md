# SCharp_GoogleSheetAPI

<p>This is my very first .NET application that integrates Google Sheet API. <br>
I have a Google Sheet which acts as my database to store my contacts' addresses and email addresses. Every December, I spend good amount of time updating this database in preparation to send out the Christmas card. 
I would like to make this application as a tool that does this hedious manual work automatically.
