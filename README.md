# SCharp_GoogleSheetAPI

<p>This is my very firs, on-going .NET application that integrates Google Sheet API. It is a simple Console application that displays all the data in google sheet as well as inserting a new row with values. <br/>
Eventually, I would like to add the ability to send out the emails using Google Gmail API as well.
